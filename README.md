# 🧠 Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify liver disease based on patient data. It includes preprocessing, training a Random Forest model, evaluating performance, and visualizing insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 615 patient records with features like age, protein levels, enzyme markers, and disease category.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Categorical encoding
- Random Forest classification
- Accuracy & classification report
- Visualizations:
  - Bar plot (average age by disease)
  - Strip plot (age distribution)
  - Box plot (bilirubin levels)
  - Feature importance chart
  - Confusion matrix heatmap

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Place the dataset file `project-data.csv` in the project directory
3. Run the script:
```bash
python liver_prediction.py
```

## 📌 Note
This is an academic/portfolio project using sample medical data.
